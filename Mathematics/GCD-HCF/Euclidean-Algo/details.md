  In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the 
  greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers (numbers), the largest number that divides them both without 
  a remainder. When that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers.
  <li> Formula: GCD (m,n)= GCD (n, m mod n). </li>
  <li> GCD(a,b) = GCD(a-b,b) if bis less than a. </li>
