# LCM (LEast Common Multiple) of a number.
<pre>
    The Least Common Multiple ( LCM ) is also referred to as the Lowest Common Multiple ( LCM ) and Least Common Divisor ( LCD) . 
    For two integers a and b, denoted LCM(a,b), the LCM is the smallest positive integer that is evenly divisible by both a and b. 
    For example, LCM(2,3) = 6 and LCM(6,10) = 30.
