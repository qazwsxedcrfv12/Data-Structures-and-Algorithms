   The logic to find the no of digits in given no is:
   Iterative approach : Traverse every digit of no and increase count by 1 until it become zero.
   Recursive approach : If no is 0 the no of digits is 0. Otherwise ( 1 + call fucntion at one less digit by n/10. )
   Direct Formula : floor(log10(n) + 1)
