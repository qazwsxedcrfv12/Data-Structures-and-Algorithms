# Divisors of a number
<pre>
  In general, if you have the prime factorization of the number n, then to calculate how many divisors it has, 
  you take all the exponents in the factorization, add 1 to each, and then multiply these "exponents + 1"s together.

  The point to be noted is divisors always appear in pairs
